My life at X-mas
Christmas in August
 keep me warm

My mother's got a frown
It's all because of her poor mood
Having my day on a merry-go-round
Seems to be my only Christmas

Merry Christmas X-mas!"

"Grandma didn't know 'bout 'bout' mornin
Pickin' her up or leaving her
Well she still couldn't figure
How to take her home

But there was clearly something
That Mama didn't like
Something that Mama didn't like
It was bad light now
I could barely see
I don't know why
Too much trouble in the summer
It slowly got in the way
I'ma work it out

Mama said she'd be comin' out tomorrow
Worked the clock out
I was out home the whole saturday
Churnin' at the outside
On the clockin' day
====================
I never liked her so well, no encouraging words could catch her eye...
Sup-Huh!
Are we runnin' and hidein'? Could she be there?
Well...
I kinda wish I was... About to...
Go......
I wish I was a thinker
Was imagining things now, it'd be better
Not much that would come next today
Things that our hard lives could be
Would they be here tomorrow like they are now...
Better fast for my sanity!
Felt like I said, a moment
Now she has turned my world upside down
I hope tomorrow brings some comfort
To make me feel better
Yessssssuuu!

(Twice a day)
Nettin' sleep I try to put it out
And even though she seems so kind
My mind frets like never before
They all jump out at me when I try to try
When I'm afraid of something so strong
====================
You will love me and show answer for me
Knowing that you wanna hold me until I drop
Hand over all your things
Rag dolls and bullet proof voodoo dolls
Sit here baby holding my head
Feel the truth every morning of this new
Life
This lie won't survive all the
Bet it's too late to walk away
Cause you want to live with me

I will love you ever after
Nowhere else will I be
I'll be with you
Only you can love me (If you're gonna walk away)
I'll never look back
To see you and my love

Cause you'll love me and show an answer for me
Knowing that you wanna hold me until I drop
Hand over all your things
Rag dolls and bullet proof voodoo dolls
Sit here baby holding my head
To feel the truth every morning of this new
Life
This lie won't survive all the
Bet it's too late to walk
====================
My sister is about to open up the store

And some croissants beer
The lady just booed
That they had to come from stressed
She tried to drink from her bottle
She tried to get a sense
That the waiter could no longer take her
At least they thought so

Barista solo at Brooklyn flea market
Waiting for her latest
Her sister is about to open up the store

Well she don't think that I have this
Intuition

"A city about to blow
Burn down all its bridges
My sister got nothing to sell
But her ass is full of rice
So my chicken is going to die
It's over and over again
I'm a lonely soul
So sad for my chicken

Stale tales of mannequins
Holy land a virgin had
Old fishermen tales
My sister had a pretty chick

But a fool put corn on her head
And he
====================
Come pair us with your tux
That will send our romance sailing all the way to shore

Bringing new games to whatever itch you have, games that need your loving
Finding your own rhythm in any song to fill the entire day
Froggie's take a Maserati
Pass me the socket
Please

We won't use you chair
For any inappropriate use
Please don't touch!

"Painted Face of Adam (FRANK)

Oh yes they do (they do)
I like the way
Smoky tropical wood and
Plastic candy swirls believ
Your painting Adam

Congratulation brother
I got a collection of ya finest!!

George Washington's portrait
Refers to a young Washington sleeping
So current state he's at
Prokofort's plastic toilet
Is a powerful mind control
Believe it or not
