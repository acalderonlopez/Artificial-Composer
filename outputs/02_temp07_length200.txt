I can't wait for the day I find you
I can't wait for the day I find you
I can't wait for the day I find you

In the middle of the night,
I can feel a glow
of bliss
That I haven't felt in years
Like this glow
Of bliss
Like the day I find you

"
"Sweetheart, every time I try to kiss her
I end up hurting her heart's desire
You're the reason I'm stoned,
I'm the reason I'm stoned

Oh, sweetheart, I can't believe that you're back
You're the reason I'm stoned
I'm the reason I'm stoned

I'm the reason, I'm the reason to be the reason to be the reason to be stoned
I'm the reason, I'm the reason I'm stoned

I'm the reason, I'm the reason to be the reason

"Dressed up to the nines
Girl's on the prowl
Just another night at the club
And I ain't seen no one

I just can't seem to get the hang of it
I'm feeling all kinda lonely
I've got a feeling
I'm gonna have to get back

And all the money I'm holding tight
I'm feeling all kinda lonely
I've got a feeling
I'm gonna have to get back

And all the money I'm holding tight
I'm feeling all kinda lonely
I've got a feeling
I'm gonna have to get back

And all the money I'm holding tight (hold tight)
I'm feeling all kinda lonely
I've got a feeling
I'm gonna have to get back

And all the money I'm holding tight (hold tight)
I'm feeling all kinda lonely
I've got a feeling
I'm gonna have to get back

"This is the time to remember
The times when we used to walk alone
And talk to nobody
And dream
And dream

This is the time
And I've cried to you
In the middle of the night
I want to bring you back
I need you

I've been looking around for a lifetime
And I'd like to find you
There on your golden bed

I'd like to hold you
And feel your touch
I'd like to hold you
And hold you
I'd like to hold you

[Chorus]
This is the time
And I've cried to you
In the middle of the night
I want to bring you back
I need you

I've been looking around for a lifetime
And I'd like to find you
There on your golden bed

"
"Sitting in the dark
Trying to figure out just what was going on
I can't
====================
On a trip down memory lane
Down memory lane
I heard you say
There was a time
When we both loved it
Somewhere in between
But I'm in love
And I'm dancing with you tonight

Down memory lane
I heard you say
There was a time
When we both loved it
Somewhere in between
But I'm in love
And I'm dancing with you tonight

"
"There's a world I've known for so long
It's no surprise that I'm trying to make it through

I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling out with you
I'm falling for you

There's a time I would've said I was sorry
And I'd've cried
But I'm falling for you

Now I've found my way
And I've found my meaning

I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling out with you
I'm falling for you
====================
And I Think I'll Be Ready
For The Time

[Chorus:]
I think I'll be ready
I think I'll be ready
For the time that's come
I think I'll be ready

[Chorus]

I think I'll be ready
Just for the time
That's all I'll be
I think I'll be ready
For the time that's come

"
"You lay your head on the pillow
I'm gonna make you mine
You tell me to go to the stars
I'm gonna make you mine

Oh, I'm gonna make you mine

I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine

I'm gonna make you mine

I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine

I'm gonna make you mine

I'm gonna make you mine

I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
