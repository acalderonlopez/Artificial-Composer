You think you're up so high,
That you're gonna let your fears go
Whilst you're sleeping (don't leave another dream on that wrong side of the night),
Walking along the sea tonight,
When your heart just breaks,
If I would that would be all I could ask for,
I know, you'd cry and tell it's done

So give me one more charmer, someone too tall,
Two too tall too afraid,
One too tall too tired,
Too old to stand,
Too blind to see,
Too blind to see,
Too blind to see,

Too many things gonna happen to me
I could feel it nearly a year
Since you've been right by my side,
Running in circles I can't understand
And I just can't make you see

Staying with me will be the hardest part,
There's nothing that you can do
But knowing that you know me well,
Ooh, we could be alright,

So give me one more charmer, someone too tall,
Two too tall too afraid,
One too tall too tired

Too many things gonna happen to me
I could feel it nearly a year
Since you've been right,
Running in circles I can't understand
And I just can't make you see

I never meant to focus your attention

====================
Seems like it've happened before,
Facing all the fools and cretin's children.
Those who need a break,
And those who don't have one.
Who needs loyalty, and scumbags who never learn.
When they think they've found their man.
And just when they start to question,
And to believe, there's nothin' so far..

They say I dreamed it when I saw you
I know I dreamed that too, dear.

Dressed up for the big time
But in my mind I'm doing just as they say.... well.... no.
I'm fine with you all day and night.
Just as long as you do you spot.
I'm fine with you all day and night.
Just as long as you do you spot.

I said I dreamin' you I dreamin' you
I dream I dream you Ill be true lingerie to me
I dream that I dream these feelings, that love and fun is
Eh..... All

You should always be the one to say ""no""".
You should always be the one to say ""no""".

"Don't give it up ain't no other way

Don't take a chance, it hasn't sunk in
I will be here for ya
Breathing that good air
'Cause I ain't afraid of something
That'll happen when
====================
Store your gift in the promised land When the picky don't leave you alone
'Cause when their candy run low, stealin' the crown
And your car stinkin' and rollin'
You ask me where the candy is
they say it is right here

Don't give me no reason not to give
Don't put you down I know
I gave you everything you've got
and now you're happy, happy you belong in the family
Hey girl I gotta tell you all
Why don't you come over here and hide

Don't throw it all a way, I know I really
should have said no but I only like to
Don't put your hands up like a puppet in the middle
Look at me I'm feeling just like I'm real
I never meant to abuse you
Say your momma's pride it won't stop and I'll hold you captive

"It's been 32 years and I can say
It's been close to 32 years
It's been such a long time(Back when I was your age)
And some things I could do to ease the pain

You were 4 when my loving arms got abused
I was lucky. I was 7 when you found out just who I was
And when it was time to you I was so free

It was through you and me that I could never go on
Those close to me say
It's been a

"How do I tell my friend that I'm sorry
I'm in a boat, playin' hollywood
Can't keep track of how I do it no more

Find another girl, change my name
Find another lover. Play 'til married.
Give me a breakdown.
Find a lover, leave him by my side.
Here she comes up and starts givin' free time.

I'm torn between trying to see both sides

"Black sands I'm cruising against, light years back.
Black sands I'm cruising against, back revving like the wind.

Black sands (into the black sands)
Satellites against the dust clouds.
I'm giving myself away behind the crowded streets.

I see the horizon,
And I spend my time in the dying ember sun.
'Cause the black sands are my friend.

He rides o'er the dusty road,
He's bringing out the dormant need of the hour.
This is his song,
He's a strange and magical being.

He rides along the land
Moves at the speed of light
And he sings the words
That time lost song have long been singing.

Black sands (into the black sands)

Care about me, my baby?
Care about me, my baby?
What are those feelings you seek
About me
They can easily wake a sleeping man
And take your life to the sky
There is no mistaking
Not for one minute
Our love is blind faith is all we share
Every little secret is laid to rest
Now if only we could use
Your arms,
And we could ever be
You do what you choose baby
Just part of the mystery
With me, oh?
Glad that we grew closer
If we can understand each other better
If we can understand each other tonight
You know that we can stay forever
And guarantee of a loving thing
Glad that we afraid of death

And we hope
Visions of you got me too
You would be a heaven in my dreams
You know that I'll pick you up
When you're in my arms again

"I can't stop thinking about you
It's too late to say that I do
I want you to want me too
Can't figure the color, and now your skin is so pale
I'm sittin' here alone, thinking 'bout you
I hope that you don't mind, how I'm trying to stay right

I can't stop thinking about you
It's

Oh Lord, no! no! oh!
Oh, take me back to your place!
Oh, ah, ooooooo, oh!!! oh!

"Found myself in bed with a burning desire
Saying it's on my mind to do just what I can do cause
Sometimes it makes me feel like a doll
I know I'm just another girl that you've been wasting away
I need you right now inside of me
I need you right now , baby

I need you , I need you
I need you , I need you
I need you right now
I need you right now , baby

I'm on my way , my time will soon be here
You and I will go our separate ways
But it's hard to keep telling myself
If the night is mine , I won't be lonely tonight
I need you, need you
I need you , I need you
I need you

I need you , and I need you, I need you
I need you , need you
I need you , I need you, I need you
I need you

"Love the way you like
Love every second of every day

====================
We got a family just a day ago, we got our first baby girl.
He said ""Your beautiful baby your beautiful baby""
I said give me my square-cover face,
And Jane took me over her knee.

I said don't you worry my dear,
It won't be long.
It won't be long!
It won't be like today.
I've got a long way to go

First thing the morning wash
Then some more paprika
Then I woke up a little drunk
I think I needed a ride
I had my breakfast omelette
It was so bland, so bland, so bland
Then I think I got the caffeine fix
I think maybe I packed some butter

Third thing I need right now
Is more chicken soup
And something to give
It's not hot anymore, its quite fried!
It's ready! Its ready!

Give a omelette to mama
Breakfast's almost over
Some of them are a mess! Too much cream
Too much corn
Too much sugar

I got some rice for you legs!
And some for you daddy's kid!
Give a omelette to mama
And give me a spoon!

Won't you help me out with my french fries?
Or give me a spoon for my mail?
Or give me a toothbrush?
My dentist is gone, the vets
====================
They sit runnin' round in their speedos
Everything they say
Is true and they're talking all right
But who's to say what
To those who are not givin'
People in the moment
Who never KNOW what is real
Who's afraid of the day
When all they want to do
Is look around
And see where everyone is stuck
Is all real
We all know what our hopes and fears
Are lookin' around
Lookin' for the dream to come true
All the time
And don't you worry
There can be a bright green light
To bring us together
Yes, the day we were born
That green light we call home
Is all that remains
To keep us laughing and dancing and
Make us smile all the time
'Cause now that it's dark and cold
And we woke up in an open window
It was a nice sunshine day
We had a nice chat before we went to bed
And it was all very somber
So we had our first make believe candle
And since the day we were born
That faceless shadow said bye
What time do we go to bed
And we're alone in the middle of the night
I don't sleep an dream and I wake up
With the glow of an angel
At 5:00a.m. on the dot 'n' near 4.
And I'm sitting beside you baby
I just want
