Airplane captain
Dov'e Ville
Voodoo queen
Moon man
Thousand miles away
In the hills of Jamaica
Forty woman Indians
Rancid tigers
Birds of heaven
That sing a song of joy
Rancid tigers
Luminescent coconuts
Little green men
Old enemies
You can count on me to tell ya
'Goodbye, ayi'yum
I swear to God
'Gloria, la'yum

A scarlet caraice
Cracks of lime
Comes pouring down
Forever rainbows

Black tar
Blues eyes
Half expecting
Unto heaven
When the flights have already departed

(Repeat Chorus)

Oh what a ride
The sunset
And all the moons of gold
With all my favorite dancing girls
With the magic of my life
And my mettle in the dance

And in the distance stars
Wend their way
To paradise
And in an instant I see my dream come true

The spirit of love that always lives
Makes it, they make it come true
They call me their dreamer
I stand before their fire
And I dance with their song

(Repeat Chorus)

(Repeat Chorus)

"This is the song
I'm glad that I found
Some way to separate me from this
I want to express my feelings
I want to hold you in my arms
I want to cry sometimes, think of all the good times
Here you are, here you are
And I try to do the same with you (I try to do the same with you)
I want to hold you in my arms

I want to feel alive, I want to feel alive
I want to feel alive, I want to feel alive

This is the song I was looking for
To express my feelings
I want to hold you in my arms
I want to cry sometimes, think of all the good times
Here you are, here you are
And I try to do the same with you (I try to do the same with you)
I want to hold you in my arms

I want
====================
You think they're cool
But I ain't cool

I don't want to know
Why you think I've been so tough
Oh, I see
You're just pretending so

I don't want to know
Why you think I've been so faithful
Oh, I see
You're just pretending so

As bad as it may be
I don't want to see you cry
So, I'm going to let it go
The old thing has got to get some fresh start
I've seen enough

"
"Seems like the other day
It's been really hard on me
And I'm so lonely
Can't sleep at night

My friends all say that I'm lonely
So many people know that I'm lonely

I just want you to know
That everything that I wanted you to see
Someday
Will only be forgotten

Soon you're to be
Soon you're to be
I want you to know
Everything that I wanted you to know

"When I was a young girl
There was Cinderella seen everybody's eye
We thought she was the sky princess
But now she's gone and everybody sees

The scene at the Astoria
When the train comes rolling by
And the princess takes a turn for the worst
People standing around and all around wishing
That Cinderella would leave and go back to her home
Or is it she still here
====================
OTTA TIPPIN' RIGHT

I put my baa down
I found a new place to be
No company there
The only one that I had
I left my blu-ray player useless and without power
Its a shame

I think I've gotten too fat
I thought I needed a drink
To feel right
But now I'm wondering
Is it worth the damage
The weight of your time
Living so tuned out
So unrefined

I put the blu-ray player up for sale
But you don't have the power
Drive the damn thing drive the fuck nuts

Its a shame

I think I've gotten too fat

I thought I needed a drink
To feel right
But now I'm wondering
Is it worth the damage
The weight of your time
Living so tuned out
So unrefined

Its a shame

"I'm proud to be blue
When I'm rushing alone
I'm aware that I'm falling through
But I go wide with it
And I'm proud to be blue

I'm going my separate ways
Since I found fame
I'm still trying to make it last
But will that be the only time I'll be blue

So I look and I look back
And then I go again
I guess I try
Cause I find I got my number pretty soon

That's how I really am

====================
Better safe than dark
Better safe than dark

Better safe than dark
I'm better safe
Better safe than dark
Drinking more beer
That dumb bitch
Ridin' on a line
Oh that bitch makes my body shiver
With an addict like her
I'm your bitch

I'm better safe than dark
Better safe than dark
Better safe than dark
I'm better safe
Better safe than dark

"
"Across the ocean
I came to meet you
You were falling into me
I was a new thing
I'm fresh out of the deep
I got no expectations
I came to find
I met you on the beach
Laughin' at you
On the sand

Higher than the moon
I knew something was wrong
I thought I saw you in the mirror
Oh well

Now there's no reason for this crazy feeling
It's already gone
You're bouncing all over me
Don't you wanna fall in love
You better be strong

(I'm better safe than dark)

Ain't no reason to panic
Not cause I know you can't
Believe in me

[Chorus]
Better safe than dark
That's my song
No more and no more
Better safe than dark

Better safe than dark
Better safe than dark
Better safe than dark

Better safe than dark
I'm gonna hit the chill
====================
You are the reason I'm alive
You are the reason I'm alive
I'm alive
And you're the reason I'm alive

I hope you know
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
You are the reason I'm alive
You are the reason I'm alive
I'm alive.
I'm alive.

I'm alive
I'm alive

I'm alive

"It's in the air
I can see you and me
In the desert
Above is the sunrise
We're just a little baby
Should be happy tonight

We'll be home
Anything to keep
Will be alright

You'll always be the warm smiled sun
In the desert
Above in the sunrise
We'll be home
Anything to keep
Will be alright

You'll always be the warm smiled sun
In the desert
Above in the sunrise
We'll be home
Anything to keep
Will be alright

You'll always be the warm smiled sun
In the desert
Above in the sunrise
We'll be home
Anything to keep
Will be alright

You'll always be the warm smiled sun
In the desert
Above in the sunrise
We'll be home
Can't, ain't nothin'
Anything to keep
You're the reason
We're just a little baby
Should be happy tonight

We'll be home
Anything to keep
Will be alright
====================
Across the summertime
You and I always wind up together
Twinkling lights on the rooftop
You and I spend evenings together
The game of mime just got fun
It's a fairy tale I can't explain
All I know is I have always loved you

You and I are the same
You seemed so wrong for two
But twice as far away
The story goes
I'll always hold on to you
And lovin' is all I can do
Now we're two memories that will both return
We will share the same door
As happily as possible
We'll be forever
Together
That's what I love most
When you and I are together

You and I are the same
You seemed so wrong for two
But twice as far away
The story goes
I'll always hold on to you
And lovin' is all I can do
Now we're two memories that will both return
We will share the same door
As happily as possible
We'll be forever
Together

"I was the biggest fool in all of history
Not because of you but because of something I wanted to do
You were the one who made me who I was
And before I realized,

I believed the power of love and the love of the whole world
You gave the gift of life to me
I believe that every prayer you give
They give us more than we give us

====================
Love and I will leave it all behind
I'll look forward to the day
I'll be free
I'll be free
I'll be free
I'll be free

I'll leave it all behind
I'll look forward to the day
I'll be free
I'll be free

I'll leave it all behind
I'll look forward to the day
I'll be free
I'll be free
I'll be free
I'll be free

"Everybody says that you drive me crazy
When in fact, I am healthy and sane
Yeah, I do drive you crazy

[Chorus]
Kick your ass, baby
Or else I might as you say
I'm gonna let you wild drive me insane

I take a backseat to my loving man
Where you really make the difference

[Chorus]

At the other end of the door
Girl, I don't feel safe at all
When I'm chasing your tail
I'm hunting for the ghost that said
Come with me, the ghost that said goodbye

I will not give up on you if that's what you mean
I ain't going to roam 'cause I need you to
And I ain't gonna be a runner

[Chorus]

The window is right at my door (X2)
You got me chasing down something that I can't find
I can't believe
====================
Only you know what I want
Long as these thoughts
Run through my mind
It's the only thing I can truly say
I know it's the no-nonsense way
To guarantee I will never run out of faith

She's so good that I feel such attraction
You watched me tear myself away from her
I want more than I can give
And I know it's true
Only you can truly love someone like she does
And if it's all over baby you can count on me to be with you
(only you can truly love someone like she does)

"I've been handed a photograph
Can't you see clearly
If you're standing next to me
I can take you for a ride

On a moving train
I must have all the information
But I can't read your face

It almost feels like a dream
Just a memory
If you'd let me have it somehow

I've just been handed
A photograph
Can't you see clearly
If you're standing next to me
I can take you for a ride
On a moving train
I must have all the information
But I can't read your face

A moving photograph
Can't you see clearly
If you're standing next to me
I can take you for a ride
On a moving train
I must have all the information
But I can't read your face

"(The Beatles)
Tragedy on the floor.
My baby in the coma.
Now I don't think I'm alone.
I don't know how anyone could ever do such a thing.
Never forget it, never forget it,
Baby we've had enough.
I'll be here at least until the end.

Baby I didn't know what I was feeling.
I didn't think I could ever let it go.
Cause I couldn't think straight.
And the phone kept ringing.

'Cause obviously baby I wasn't right.
And I would never
