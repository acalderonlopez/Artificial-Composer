""Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey""
This is what the world was like when you

Girl, can't you see,
Mommy and my baby,
Daughter do things to me and me
So they don't belong in the back seat,

I wish, I wish, I wish I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish

'Cause though I've been living in such a big
 big bubble,
now it's my turn
To be the world's biggest

Baby, mm

I've got so much fun,
I'm so happy
So happy
Someday I'm gonna
Be the world's biggest

Baby, mm

In the morning
I'm so happy
I'm so happy
Someday I'm gonna
Be the world's

Show me the sky
Out in the blue without a shadow
Out in the blue I need to be high
Wherever you go I'll be alright
Don't know who you are
I need you to make me feel alright
Hey hey I don't know
I need you to make me feel alright

"It's the wrong place at the wrong time
It's the wrong place and it's bad for me
I don't want you back out there
I wish you were here
And I would never do it again
Hold me close, hold me tight
If we can keep this up I'll never let you out of sight
Tell me, tell me
Tell me what's right
If you don't know how to say it
Hold me close, hold me tight
If you just can't let go
Don't ask me for a kiss
It hurts to be alone again

Too long on the train

You are not the same
I am not the same

Not your fault

"Sometimes I cry, play around in the woods for a while
Start a fire, and then hey, what's your problem

I'm on fire fighting in the middle of the night
Fire's here to stay
If these old men had their way
 they'd have us gone

I'm on fire fighting in the middle of the night
I'm on fire fighting in the middle of the night
You know I mean every little foul

I'm on fire

Sometimes I feel like a fool, thinking all my action
is just for fun
My friends say I'm losing my mind
Why can't I just live my life

I'm on fire fighting in the middle of the night
I'm on fire fighting in the middle of

Tell him to get to me, boy
Cause I'm gonna catch you
Cause I'm gonna do it

Someone else is gonna take the lead
For me and you
And I may have a bit of sway
Maybe I turn a little bit wild
Cause in this world towards the people
There's a lot of people that need your help
And I don't claim to be somebody 'cause I've tried
But this is my religion
You gotta be part of the fold
You can live in the world as I do
You can make your own decisions 'cause you're a part of the fold
You gotta belong to me
You gotta try to make their point
You've got to believe what they say
I've tried to live my life
Through hard times, but I've just got to live my life
Through love and kindness
You can live in our world as I do
You can make your own decisions
because you're a part of

By Dan - December 17, 1789

Apart from school, nothing you had went to school for.
And you were never far,
No school bus, no babysitter.
You see, your education was,
Then, You were 'round the bend.

Thus you went,
And you've been through hell and back again.
Ain't this how it has been,
Like you're fresh out of college.
Everything,
I've seen is just how you planned it.
Doing what you had to do.

So you walked out on school,
You threw your diploma on the floor.
And yeah,
It seems you lied to the truth.
And now I know

I'm gonna love you
The way that I do.
The way that I do.
And I'm gonna love you from behind.
The way

[Chorus]
