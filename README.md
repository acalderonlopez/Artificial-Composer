This project was created as a first approach to a Machine Learning algorithm that allowed us to create new song lyrics based on a [55000+ song lyrics database](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics) found on Kaggle and afterwards create different MIDI ringtones based on a [recurrent neural network that had been trained on thousands of MIDI files.](https://github.com/asfrattini/Artificial-Composer/blob/master/images/basic_rnn.mag) 

We also decided to make the most of this tool by choosing some of the lyrics that were outputted to create different wallpapers with celebrities that might, in general terms, have them in their songs. Even though when you took a closer look into them, they would probably be **meaningless and weird.**

<h3>Part 1: GPT-2 Text Generator</h3>

<h4>Training the model</h4>

In order to train a model with our song lyrics database we used a [google colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce) that allowed us to use our own database in order to change the output of the program.
